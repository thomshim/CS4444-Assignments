    lastname_firstname_pi.py — Python code

    lastname_firstname_report.pdf — short report

Goals:

    Estimate π using Monte Carlo sampling in Python with NumPy.
    Study how accuracy improves as the number of trials increases.
    Show empirically that the sampling distribution of the estimator is approximately Normal (Central Limit Theorem).

Tasks:

    Monte Carlo π estimator

    Generate random points (x,y) in the unit square. Count how many fall inside the unit circle.
    Implement this as a function estimate_pi(n).

    Convergence with n

    Compute π with different values of n

    Plot estimated π versus n (x-axis log scale)

    Sampling distribution at fixed n

    Choose at least 3 values of n (e.g., 10^3, 10^4, 10^5).

    For each, repeat the experiment R = 500 times. According to the Central Limit Theorem, how should your estimated π be distributed?

    Plot the histogram of estimates. Show it resembles a normal distribution.
